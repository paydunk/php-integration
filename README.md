### Usage:

Request API access and register applications at https://developers.paydunk.com. Check in the Applications tab to view all of your apps. You'll see each of your apps are given an App ID and App Secret.

Along with the front-end plugin (found here: https://github.com/paydunk/front-end-plugin), use our quick-start.php file to get started with paydunk quickly. Run your transaction as you see fit using the information POSTED from the Paydunk API. Be sure to update the status, client_id (App ID) and client_secret (App Secret) values (lines 31, 35 and 36)!
